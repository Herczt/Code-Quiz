# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project is a code quiz to test your knowledge on basic coding fundamentals. The site has a built in timer that tracks your progress throughout the quiz. You start with 60 seconds, if a question is answered correctly you are awarded 10 additional seconds. If the question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. The timer is essentially your score, the higher number you end with, the better you did on the quiz.
